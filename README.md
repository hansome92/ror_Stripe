# Description

We will be creating models that interface with [Stripe's API](https://stripe.com/docs/api). A [Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) is required in order to work with their API (it's free). Alright, let's get started!

# Problem

We currently have a `Customer` model that needs to have payment support added to it using Stripe. There needs to be the ability to 

- Add a credit card to a `Customer`
- Update the `Customer`'s credit card if it changes
- Remove the `Customer`'s credit card
- Charge a `Customer`'s credit card 

Please have RSpec tests written to support your solution. You are not required to write any views or controllers.
